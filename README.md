##  Branching Strategy

This project uses two main branches:

- **main**:  
  Production-ready code. This branch contains only tested and working versions of the project.

- **dev**:  
  Development branch. All updates, experiments, and features are pushed here first.

### Workflow

1. All development happens in the `dev` branch.
2. After testing and verification, changes are merged from `dev` into `main`.
